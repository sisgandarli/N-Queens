# N-Queens
The project's aim is to solve famous "N-Queens" problem and visualize one of the solution boards.
The algorithm used to solve this **constraint satisfaction problem** is called **_backtracking search algorithm_**.

1. Make my changes
  1. Fix bug
  2. Improve formatting
    * Make the headings bigger
2. Push my commits to GitHub
3. Open a pull request
  * Describe my changes
  * Mention all the members of my team
    * Ask for feedback
# Usage
1. Download the project
2. Import the project to a Java IDE (Intellij IDEA is preferred)
3. Build the project and run it
4. Write the number of queens in the text box 
5. Click "Run!" button
6. See the result
  * If your input was not correct (empty box or non-numeric characters) you will see an error message
  * Else if your input is larger than 19, you will receive an message informing that the number is too large. This constaint is used because of time complexity of backtracking search algorithm
  * Else you will see one of the solution boards of famous "N-Queens" problem
  
# Result
Here is one of the solution boards for 8 queens:
